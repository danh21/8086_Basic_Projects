    - powerOfNum: enter the exponent in range of 0-9. If exponent is valid, program prints 'T' and calculates power of two. Otherwise, it prints 'F' and repeats again. To exit program, press esc key.

    - calcArithmetic: 
        + Version 1: enter 2 numbers in range of 0-9 (1 digit). If number is valid, program calculates arithmetic between 2 operands (summation, subtraction, multiplication, division) and displays results. If number is invalid, program asks user to enter number again.
        + Version 2: enter the number of digits for 2 operands (1-4). If the number of digits is valid, program prints 'T' and asks user to enter 2 numbers. Program calculates arithmetic between 2 operands (summation, subtraction) and displays results. Otherwise, program prints 'F' and asks user to enter again.

    - bin2dec: converts binary sequence to decimal value.

    - dec2bin: converts decimal value to binary sequence, then specifies that value is either even or odd.
